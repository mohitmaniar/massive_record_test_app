== Welcome to MassiveRecord test application

This is just a small example application on how to set up a few classes
and associations. I used Rails 3.1 RC just for fun, but it seems to me
that there have been changes to the ActiveSupport::JSON no longer using
YAML as back-end which seems to affect MassiveRecord::ORM::Base.coder a bit.

Anyways, we'll fix that in MassiveRecord at some point, but for now
you should use MassiveRecord with Rails 3.0.x, and not 3.1.
